# Introduction

First of all, thank you to be here, any contribute here is welcome, and your help can be vital to keep this project alive and to make it a great library.

## Requirements
Here I define a standard enviroment and list of software suggested or required to develop without throubles.

If you prefer to use different software or enviroment you are free to do,but here we don't provide support for that.

### Recommended enviroment

The project is multi platform, but here I recommend:

- **Operating system:** Windows 10
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition

### Required Software

- **.NET Framework:** [.NET Core 2.2.300 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
- **Java JDK:** [Java SE Development Kit 12.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)

### Enviroment Variables

- **JAVA_HOME**: Add JAVA_HOME to System enviroment variables, and set *C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.1* as PATH
- **PATH**: Add  %JAVA_HOME%\bin to Enviroment PATH System Variables

### Enable powershell script

Open powershell and launch this command: `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`

This will allow you to run unsigned scripts.

### Recommended extensions

The following Visual Studio extensions are not necessary, but they can be useful:

- Markdowncan improve they  editor
- Output enhamcer
- Powershell tools
- Real clean
